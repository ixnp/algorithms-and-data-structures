# Student-led whiteboarding

In order to help students effectively prepare for technical interviewing, Flatiron School may adopt a practice of regular (daily?) whiteboarding practice which incorporates elements of public speaking, technical whiteboarding, algorithms study and general technical skills.

The goals for the students are:
* To iterate through several technical whiteboarding experiences
* To discover and practice effective communication styles for the WB process.
* To observe different WB styles
* To be exposed to a variety of technical questions and solutions.


The goal for each session is to allow a selected student to answer a pair of questions at a regular point in the day. 
* This session **is** meant to focus to exposure to _new technical material_ and the _interviewing format_. 
* The session is **not** meant to expand into long-form algorithm discussion or lecture.

As the cohort moves through the mods, the timing of the problem _will change_, from the day before to getting the prompt while presenting.

#### Pre-session:
* A student will volunteer to present the following day.
The student will be given a problem to present a solution to.
* The problem should be in the format of a requirement - no sample code. 
* If it’s more than one or two sentences, it’s probably too big.
    * Example: “Write a JavaScript function to get the last element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the last 'n' elements of the array.”
* The student that will present shall prepare a solution, and also find a problem to present following to the following student.

#### Session format - Phase 1 (may repeat):
##### Time estimate: 30 minutes.

* The student will present the problem, their understanding, and how the prompt guided their thinking (2-3mins)
* The student will present their solution (10-15min)
* The class will give feedback, depending on the solution. (5-10min)
* The student will collect a volunteer, and present the next prompt.
* No student may present twice before each other student has presented once, and so on.


Session format -  Phase 2:

When the students reach the point-of-no-return (mod 4?) the problems will be presented at the standup, rather than the day before. This will allow students to practice generating solutions on-the-fly. It’s important that for these questions the students providing the prompt has a solution they can answer questions and guide the presenter towards.

#### Soft Questions

The students will first be given a “soft” technical question from a SEC/DSC to answer. This question should be “theoretical”, and answerable in a short response, perhaps with relevant examples. They can be definition based, or more open ended.

Examples:

    What is an object?
    What are some HTTP verbs, and how are they different?
    How does the internet work?

#### Hard Questions

Next the “hard” technical question format will be similar to Phase 1, but with the prompt presented **at that moment**.

* The “interviewer” will present the problem (1min)
* The student will verify their understanding, and ask any follow up questions they may have (2-5mins)
The student will present their solution (10-15min)
* The class will give feedback, depending on the solution. (5-10min)
* The student will collect a volunteer, and present the next prompt.
* No student may present twice before each other student has presented once, and so on.

#### Verifying Efficacy

As most cohorts will cycle through Phase 1 several times during their course, we should look for consistent improvement from cycle to cycle.

Feedback for students should happen live, as the feedback will certainly inform not only the student that presented, but also other students in the cohort, and will help increase the speed of improvement.
