# Algorithms and Data Structures 

The purpose of this repository is to build and collect content focused on technical interviews. 

## Contributing Content 

Contributors are free to upload content. For the sake of organization keep a few best practices in mind.
 * Avoid duplicate content. (the same problems in different languages do not count however if you create a solution create a comment that references your solution in the original problem file.)
 * Before deleting content reach out to the contributor who wrote it or the owner of this repository.
 * Cite outside sources! 
 * Keep content organized, well labeled and easy to find.
