# Algorithms and Data Structures 

The purpose of this repository is to build and collect content focused on technical interviews. 

## Contributing Content 

Contributors are free to upload content. For the sake of organization keep a few best practices in mind.
 * Avoid duplicate content. (the same problems in different languages do not count however if you create a solution create a comment that references your solution in the original problem file.)
 * Before deleting content reach out to the contributor who wrote it or the owner of this repository.
 * Cite outside sources! 
 * Keep content organized, well labeled and easy to find.

### Technical Assessments
Many companies in the greater Seattle area have the expectation that an interviewer can effectively communicate their ideas and solve a technical challenge. These challenges can come in the form of a take-home problem, pair-programming and often on-site whiteboard interview. The content in this repository will prepare students for these technical challenges.  
## Preparation for these interviews are split into 3 categories:
 * TIPS lectures: How to approach algorithms and the whiteboard interviews process.

 * DSA lectures: A dive into data structures commonly used for interview questions. Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists, Graphs, Trees and Hashes are covered here

 * Daily Algorithm challenges: Daily practice problems that increase with difficulty as the students progress through the mods.


### TODOs


 * Add problems 

 * Make problems language agnostic

 * Add difficulty level to problems

 * Add multiple solutions in ruby, python and JavaScript

 * Add bigO to solutions 

 * Add timeline with release date suggestions 

 * improve README 

 * Add Data Science content 
 
 * Add TODOs as issues 

 * write tests 

 * add lecture slides
